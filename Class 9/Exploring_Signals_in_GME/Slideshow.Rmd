## Reason

* Exploration of signals within a stock price can be a difficult and tedious process.
* Automation of this process could result in more people being involved in the stock market
* Relevance in current zeitgeist with Gamestop and the culture currently around it


## Original Design

I developed the original plot as a part the Johns Hopkins Coursera Data Science course. The code was useful and reproducible, and so I implementation it in a shiny app. 

## Original Plot

```{r, warning = F, message = F}
library(plotly)
library(quantmod)
library(TTR)
library(tidyverse)

getSymbols("GME", source = 'yahoo')

df <- data.frame(Date = index(GME), coredata(GME))

df <- df %>%
        mutate(movement = if_else(GME.Close >= GME.Open, "Increasing", "Decreasing")) %>%
        mutate(avg_30 = SMA(GME.Close, n = 30),
               avg_90 = SMA(GME.Close, n = 90)) %>%
        mutate(good_signal = if_else(avg_30 >= avg_90, 1, 0)) %>%
        mutate(buy = if_else(good_signal - lag(good_signal) == 1, 1, 0),
               sell = if_else(good_signal - lag(good_signal) == -1, 1, 0)) %>%
        filter(Date >= "2020/06/01")

buys <- df %>%
        filter(buy == 1)

sell <- df %>%
        filter(sell == 1)

i <- list(line = list(color = 'black'))
d <- list(line = list(color = 'red'))

fig <- df %>%
        plot_ly(x = ~Date, type = "candlestick",
                open = ~GME.Open, close = ~GME.Close,
                high = ~GME.High, low = ~GME.Low, name = "GME",
                increasing = i, decreasing = d, width = 1000, height = 600) %>%
        add_lines(y = ~avg_30, name = "Closing 30D MvgAvg",
                  line = list(color = 'cadetblue')) %>%
        add_lines(y = ~avg_90, name = "Closing 90D MvgAvg",
                  line = list(color = 'blue')) %>%
        add_segments(x = buys$Date, xend = buys$Date, y = 0, yend = 500, line = list(color = "green"), name = "Buy Signal") %>%
        add_segments(x = sell$Date, xend = sell$Date, y = 0, yend = 500, line = list(color = "orange"), name = "Sell Signal") %>%
        layout(yaxis = list(title = "Price"))
        
fig
```


## Updates

The code has been refactored to allow for every stock ticker on the Yahoo! Finance Database with user input, driving exploration and learning.
